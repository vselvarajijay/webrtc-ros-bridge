# If you run frodobots-earth-rovers as a service elsewhere, point ROS2 at it:
# SDK_URL=http://frodobots:8000
# Or leave unset if not using the SDK service.

# Build locally (faster): use ./compose-build-local.sh up --build instead of
# docker compose up --build, so the default local builder is used instead of
# a remote builder (which causes slow export/transfer).
